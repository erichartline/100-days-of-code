# 100 Days Of Code - Log

Unfortunately, this was the end of this #100DaysOfCode streak, but I am back now after four days and coding again. Maybe this time I will start a generic coding journal.

### Day 27: Thursday, July 6, 2017

**Today's Progress** I watched most of this week's M101JS videos and read more YDKJS.

**Thoughts:** Unfortunately, I think this is going to be the end of this edition of #100DaysOfCode. I was able to fit in some time for videos and some reading today, but I'm not sure if I will have any time at all to do anything coding-related for the next few days. If that changes, I'll keep this going, but it sounds like it's going to be a very busy trip.

### Day 26: Wednesday, July 5, 2017

**Today's Progress** I went through some Redux stuff trying to solve a bug in my team project, and I read some YDKJS.

**Thoughts:** Was really busy today so I didn't get a ton done. I spent some time debugging a Redux authentication issue (still not solved, unfortunately), then I read some YDKJS when I had some time tonight. I should have a little more time to code tomorrow, but my streak may be in jeopardy starting on Friday (heading out of state to deal with some family matters).

### Day 26: Tuesday, July 4, 2017

**Today's Progress** I created a new React boilerplate for my future projects, and I started playing around with Canvas in my team project.

**Thoughts:** I started looking around at upcoming freeCodeCamp projects and got inspired to build my own custom React boilerplate for future use in them. This took me a bit longer than I anticipated, as I was essentially trying to bridge the gap between what I knew from the dated Udemy course boilerplate I was using and the new Webpack 3/Router 4/etc features from a different boilerplate we used in my team project. I decided to just do my own thing, taking what I knew from using both of these and crafting it in my own vision. It's still a work in progress, but I'm happy to get it working all on my own. After finishing this, I dove right into my team project and started working on a new branch to develop a Canvas component. I made my own canvas but also found a couple of libraries that might work even better with React. Something to dig into more tomorrow...

### Day 25: Monday, July 3, 2017

**Today's Progress** I watched some React videos and added some basic content to my team project.

**Thoughts:** Wasn't sure I was going to have time to code today, but I was able to squeeze in some work really late. I watched some React videos earlier in the day, but for actual coding I did some basic work on my team project. Now I have collaborative access to the main repo, so I went ahead and pulled the latest version, added a footer component and made some simple changes, then pushed it back to the master branch. Still getting the hang of proper Git workflow as a team, but it seems much easier now with direct access to the repo.

### Day 24: Sunday, July 2, 2017

**Today's Progress** I finished this week's M101JS homework and studied up on some React.

**Thoughts:** Didn't have much time today so I just focused on getting the M101JS homework done on time. Much better this week -- I enjoyed learning about indexes more than schema. I also did a bit of a refresher on basic React so I can start developing a couple specific components for my team project.

### Day 23: Saturday, July 1, 2017

**Today's Progress** I finished the Redux section of the course, started this week's M101JS material and worked on my Chingu team project.

**Thoughts:** I'm pretty happy to finish the Redux section because I'm ready to move on to building my own projects now. This Udemy course has been great, don't get me wrong, but I'm starting to get that itch to develop something that isn't just a code-along. I started doing some preliminary stuff with components in my team project, mainly just basic cleanup and adding in a couple of simple components. I also started this week's M101JS material since that is due in a few days.

### Day 22: Friday, June 30, 2017

**Today's Progress** I continued working through the Redux part of the course.

**Thoughts:** I'm almost done with the Redux section. I felt like I had a pretty solid grasp on the examples he had us go through, but now it's getting really complex with the refactoring of the Todo app. I'm going to keep pushing through, but I definitely feel like I will need another Redux learning supplement after this.

### Day 21: Thursday, June 29, 2017

**Today's Progress** I started the Redux section of my course and finished reading the third YDKJS book.

**Thoughts:** Spent most of the day coding. Not entirely sure what to make of Redux so far. YDKJS was an interesting read, especially considering its less-than-glowing remarks about ES6's `class` mechanism. Kind of funny since React is so heavy on classes.

### Day 20: Wednesday, June 28, 2017

**Today's Progress** I finished the React todo app from my course.

**Thoughts:** The app actually turned out pretty cool! This was another great learning experience since it showed how to use local storage to create and remove items from the todo list. It also incorporated Moment, which I had used before for an API project, as a way to keep track of when an item was created and completed. Overall, I feel good about being able to retain most of what I learned, though I'm still not 100% confident in the testing methods used. It looks like the next section involves using Redux to add new features to the app, so I'm looking forward to seeing how all of that comes together.

### Day 19: Tuesday, June 27, 2017

**Today's Progress** I went to a Vue.js meetup.

**Thoughts:** I have been trying to go to at least one coding-related meetup every week, so I decided to check out a Vue.js workshop downtown. The event was kind of a mixed bag for me personally, mainly because my first hour was spent trying to get their repo to work on my laptop. None of the devs knew what was causing the issue, but eventually I figured it out on my own. Turns out that it was nearly the same problem I ran into with a React project recently -- I had to change the `dev` script in `package.json` to something else to run in Windows. I swear that every Windows-specific bug I run into is making me want to go exclusively to Linux. But I digress. After that, I tried to catch up to where they were at in the workshop, but I had already fallen so far behind. The app they were building -- a "Tinder for TV shows" -- was pretty cool so I want to play around with it some more. The little bit of Vue that I picked up was interesting, too, and it is kind of giving me a "React mixed with jQuery" vibe. I can see why some people prefer to use Vue as an intro framework rather than React. The most fruitful part of the workshop, however, came after the event had ended. I was able to stick around and talk to a couple of the company's developers, including a junior dev who gave me some great job search and career advice. That alone made the experience worth it.

### Day 18: Monday, June 26, 2017

**Today's Progress** I spent a few hours working on the React Todo app from my course.

**Thoughts:** I decided to make it my main goal to plow through this course and really try to get a solid understanding of React. I'm about halfway through the todo app section, and I feel like some things are really starting to click now. I've got the basic syntax of React classes down pat now, and I'm starting to get the hang of the tests with Karma. This section also had an insightful detour into the ES6 spread operator, which seems like it will be incredibly useful.

### Day 17: Sunday, June 25, 2017

**Today's Progress** I finished the week 4 homework for M101JS and read a bunch of YDKJS.

**Thoughts:** Didn't have as much hands-on coding time, so today was a great day to get some reading in. I'm almost done with the third book of YDKJS -- just one chapter left -- and I hope to finish it tomorrow. This book is definitely more challenging than the first two, and I can tell it's going to require more than one read to get a good grasp of its many new concepts. I do still feel I am learning a lot though. The homework for week 4 of M101JS wasn't as engaging as the third week -- just three questions, one of which felt too subjective to be given a strict answer. The course kind of seems hit-or-miss so far, but I'm going to stick with it. Besides more reading, tomorrow I will be getting back into React.

### Day 16: Saturday, June 24, 2017

**Today's Progress** I spent a good eight hours learning React.

**Thoughts:** I wanted to get a better understanding of React so I decided to finish up the timer/countdown project from Andrew Mead's Udemy course. There was *a lot* of content to digest (and definitely some stuff I will need to go back and revisit), but overall I feel I learned quite a bit. Perhaps most interesting was how we added in testing using Karma/Mocha/Expect. Doing test-driven development is something I have been wanting to learn about for a while now, so it was really cool to see it implemented in real-time for a major project like this. This app seems like a strong basis that I can use when I rebuild my own Pomodoro clock with React in the future.

### Day 15: Friday, June 23, 2017

**Today's Progress** I updated my personal portfolio, watched most of the videos from week 4 of M101JS, read some YDKJS, worked on my team project and had an interview with a recruiter.

**Thoughts:** Feel like I did a little bit of everything today. I had been meaning to update my personal website ever since finishing my Simon game project, so I finally went ahead and did that. I also added some skills and a "currently learning" line, much like my LinkedIn profile. I made some small changes to components in my team project, but I feel I still need to get a better understanding of `state` and passing around props.

### Day 14: Thursday, June 22, 2017

**Today's Progress** I worked on my Chingu team project. and had an interview with a recruiter.

**Thoughts:** I spent a lot of time on this today but didn't get nearly as far as I had hoped. I decided to focus on adding our components and making sure that everything would be linked together properly. What should have been so simple -- importing one component into another -- ended up being a major process. I spent hours trying to figure out why it wasn't working, rewriting my `const` statement to a `class` and vice versa, changing my routing patterns, trying new components. Nothing worked. It wasn't until my partner happened to change the file and folder reference from `./containers/Canvas` to `./Canvas` that it all worked. Of course it was so simple after all! On the plus side, thinking it was an issue with upgrading to React Router v4, we both read the docs and learned the differences between the new and old versions. Wasn't the problem but still good info to know.

### Day 13: Wednesday, June 21, 2017

**Today's Progress** I went to my first presentation-style meetup: "Beautify your async flow with generators/async+await & Koajs".

**Thoughts:** To be honest, a lot of the presentation material went over my head, but I did have a good time at the meetup. I met my cohort partner in person and discussed a more detailed gameplan for our project, got some Node.js swag and checked out Braintree's really cool office. Seeing their decked-out location has me even more excited to get my first dev job! Tomorrow I will have a lot of coding time available, so I'm aiming to get a lot done.

### Day 12: Tuesday, June 20, 2017

**Today's Progress** I worked on adding some Foundation styling to my team project, and submitted my first `pull request` for it.

**Thoughts:** This was definitely trickier than it seems, and it took me an hour plus to get everything implemented correctly. The Udemy course I have been following along with is great, but it is so, so dated, and the discrepancies between it and the new boilerplate we have been working with are jarring. I had to install additional modules, add in some stuff (brand new to me) to webpack.config.js, and adjust the package.json start line to work correctly with Windows. There are a ton of moving pieces already, and we haven't even started adding components. This is a HUGE learning experience, but it is totally going to be worth it.

### Day 11: Monday, June 19, 2017

**Today's Progress** I finished the second book of YDKJS and attempted to start working on my team project.

**Thoughts:** I was hoping to get in a good coding session this afternoon for my Chingu team project, but I ended up spending most of my time debugging. I couldn't figure out for the life of me why our React boilerplate wasn't working. Eventually I figured out that some files got lost in the transition, including the ever-crucial .babelrc, and that was causing all sorts of errors. We have a functional boilerplate now, however, so it's time to get coding.

### Day 10: Sunday, June 18, 2017

**Today's Progress** I read some YDKJS, went through a Canvas guide on JavaScript 30, and learned about testing with Expect.

**Thoughts:** Didn't get as much coding done today as I hoped, but at the very least I am almost finished with book 2 of YDKJS. The Canvas guide I went through was really cool -- that's going to come in handy for my upcoming Chingu collaboration.

### Day 9: Saturday, June 17, 2017

**Today's Progress** I finished week 3 of M101JS, started the React Timer app in Andrew Mead's React course and read some YDKJS.

**Thoughts:** This week's homework was a bit of a drag. There was a lot to take in with little in the way of quiz breaks, so it was hard to retain some of the features that were discussed. The homework only had two real challenges, and they only involved writing a few lines of code. On the plus side, there were a few videos about using Twitter's API, and those showed a side of MongoDB's capabilities that I didn't know about. I'm about 1/4 through the React Timer section in the Udemy course. Mostly review so far, but it did bring up some cool points about SCSS (namely that you can use partials with _ at the beginning of the filename and then bring them altogether with one stylesheet). I think tomorrow I'm going to do more reading and try to finish the second YDKJS book.

### Day 8: Friday, June 16, 2017

**Today's Progress** I finished the weather app (through section 7) in Andrew Mead's React course. I also watched the first few videos in week 3 of M101JS.

**Thoughts:** In the final section of the weather app, the instructor had us add in some pretty cool features -- Foundation, custom CSS and SCSS. I was pretty happy about that because I was wondering how the styling could be included in a React app. We also added in some error modal popups and got the nav bar search to work properly. All really useful stuff, and I'm excited to dig into Foundation more. It looks like a good alternative to Bootstrap, which I was kind of getting tired of.

I thought about taking a break from the course to rebuild my old FCC weather app, but I think I'm going to push through and continue learning more about React. I do plan on rebuilding the weather app afterward, however.

### Day 7: Thursday, June 15, 2017

**Today's Progress** I worked all the way through the first six sections of Andrew Mead's React course.

**Thoughts:** The React weather app is coming along nicely! It still looks crude, but styling is coming soon. Everything is functional as of now, including working subpages. The content is very basic -- you can only get temperature by typing in a city -- but I'm very pleased to have a working app. I feel like I've been learning a lot from the course, and I'm glad that the instructor added in some ES6 content after all. I'm starting to get used to writing out fat arrow functions, and definitely getting the appeal of them.

### Day 6: Wednesday, June 14, 2017

**Today's Progress** I worked on my React course.

**Thoughts:** I got the early stages of the React weather app done. It's nice to finally have Webpack working properly, and today's coding was mostly error-free. One nice surprise in this course was a section on ES6 promises, which served as a good complement to last night's workshop. I have tomorrow wide open, so I plan on maximizing my coding time as much as possible.

I also spoke to a recruiter today about a junior dev role that I might be a good fit for. Talking more about it next week, here's hoping!

### Day 5: Tuesday, June 13, 2017

**Today's Progress** I went to a NodeSchool meetup!

**Thoughts:** I didn't get to do any React work done during the day, but I went to my first NodeSchool meetup tonight. It was actually a lot of fun! I worked on the 'promise-it-wont-hurt' workshop, and was able to finish half of the challenges while teaming up with someone else. Overall, it was a great time since I feel I learned a lot, and I got to meet some cool people. Apparently there is another Node.js meetup next week, so I am going to try to do that as well.

### Day 4: Monday, June 12, 2017

**Today's Progress** I worked on fixing that Webpack bug from yesterday.

**Thoughts:** It took a while, but I solved the problem! A fellow Chingu in my Slack #chingu-central channel pushed me in the right direction. We discovered that the dev dependencies weren't installing, and a bug in NPM5 was wiping out my regular dependencies when I ran `npm install --only=dev`. I rolled back to  NPM4, ran `npm install` then `npm install --only=dev` and voila, `webpack` worked! Although I was frustrated with all of the error messages, the debugging process ended up being very enlightening. I'm going to try to work on the React some more during the day tomorrow, then it's off to a NodeSchool event at night!

### Day 3: Sunday, June 11, 2017

**Today's Progress** More React Udemy work.

**Thoughts:** I ran into some issues with Webpack, and they severely derailed my course progress. I had copied over my React boilerplate to get started on the new weather app, but I kept getting `Cannot resolve module 'babel-loader'` errors every time I would run `webpack`. I spent a couple hours trying to figure this out, but none of the 'fixes' I found worked. I had to leave for the evening but I was still in the coding mood, so I went through the entire JavaScript section in the SoloLearn phone app.

### Day 2: Saturday, June 10, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I finished Week 2 of M101JS, did a couple sections of my React Udemy course and read a chapter of the second YDKJS book.

**Thoughts:** I feel like I had a very productive day today -- basically a full work day of coding. I started off by doing everything required in Week 2 of M101JS. I enjoyed this quite a bit since it focused on what commands are needed for CRUD in MongoDB. The homework questions were especially helpful since they required a lot of trial and error in finding the right syntax to look things up in their movie database. I'm digging this class so far.

After finishing that, I started venturing back into my React learning. I went back to Andrew Mead's "The Complete React Web App Developer Course" on Udemy and finished the HelloReact and ReactBoilerPlate projects. I'm liking his teaching style more than the other React Udemy course I picked up, but it is a little disappointing that it doesn't use as much ES6. I suppose it doesn't hurt to learn the old syntax, too, though.

The next project in the course involves building a weather app, and I'm really excited to see how that goes. I already built a weather app using JavaScript and jQuery, so it would be fun to update it to use React instead.

Finally, I started re-reading You Don't Know JS: Scope & Closures. I read this a few months ago but got sidetracked on the third book. This time I plan on finishing the entire series in order.

### Day 1: Friday, June 9, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I finished Week 1 of M101JS.

**Thoughts:** I have been coding a ton lately, but I felt I needed to start writing about my experiences again. What better way to do that than start up #100DaysOfCode once again? My goal this time around is to be more active with other developers while also learning more about React and Node.js. I finished my front end certificate from freeCodeCamp last month and I'm ready to start digging into some heavier stuff. I also plan on finishing the YDKJS books this month.

Next Tuesday I'm going to a NodeSchool event, so I figured I should brush back up on Node.js. I noticed that MongoDB University's M101JS class started a new session, so I joined that. Even though the grading period for week one is over, I still went ahead and finished the homework and extra credit assignment. I also created a repo to store my assignments.

I'm not sure that I love the teaching style of the class -- they just give you ZIP files of the material and go too fast so you can't really code along yourself -- but the extra homework assignment really helped lock things in for me. I'm starting to feel a bit more familiar in navigating through MongoDB using the command line, and I'm getting up to speed with basic Node.js syntax.

It also seemed fitting to start this journal back up again since today is the first day of the June Chingu cohort. I'm in the Chameleons group this time, and I plan on joining one of the team projects. Not sure yet if I want to do the Slackbot one or an open project.
