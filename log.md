# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Friday, June 9, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I finished Week 1 of M101JS.

**Thoughts:** I have been coding a ton lately, but I felt I needed to start writing about my experiences again. What better way to do that than start up #100DaysOfCode once again? My goal this time around is to be more active with other developers while also learning more about React and Node.js. I finished my front end certificate from freeCodeCamp last month and I'm ready to start digging into some heavier stuff. I also plan on finishing the YDKJS books this month.

Next Tuesday I'm going to a NodeSchool event, so I figured I should brush back up on Node.js. I noticed that MongoDB University's M101JS class started a new session, so I joined that. Even though the grading period for week one is over, I still went ahead and finished the homework and extra credit assignment. I also created a repo to store my assignments.

I'm not sure that I love the teaching style of the class -- they just give you ZIP files of the material and go too fast so you can't really code along yourself -- but the extra homework assignment really helped lock things in for me. I'm starting to feel a bit more familiar in navigating through MongoDB using the command line, and I'm getting up to speed with basic Node.js syntax.

It also seemed fitting to start this journal back up again since today is the first day of the June Chingu cohort. I'm in the Chameleons group this time, and I plan on joining one of the team projects. Not sure yet if I want to do the Slackbot one or an open project.
